# System Verilog

# UVM:
1. My favorite project on UVM for candy lovers: 
    - Rather than using any protocol this project uses candy to understand uvm in fun and intutive way. 
    - the project is quite wholesome and contains top, env, agent, driver, transactions, sequencer, sequence, and interface. 
    - though i do plan to add coverage and other stuff but it doesn't exist yet. 
    - Clean uvm prints makes it easy to understand the working
2. adder-subtractor:
    - done to understand the basics of uvm environment and connections. 
3. Protocol 
    - to get the verification wala feel hahaha....ðŸ™‚
